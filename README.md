# Cricket_World_Cup_EDA_Project
This project explores the rich history and dynamics of the Cricket World Cup through an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset spans from the inaugural World Cup in 1975 to the present and includes information on innings, matches, teams, venues, umpires, and notable performances like centuries.
